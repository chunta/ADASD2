## Note
Based on the design specifications, the iPad and iPhone screens have different layouts, so separate views have been implemented.\
However, it's worth mentioning that an alternative approach using a single view was considered to reduce maintenance efforts.\
One possible alternative approach involved using a single view that would adapt its layout based on the device's characteristics,\
such as size classes.\
This approach aimed to simplify the codebase by maintaining only one view instead of separate views for iPad and iPhone.
